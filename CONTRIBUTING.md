## Tests

### Tests' Location

Tests should go into the tests/ directory.

### Test Naming

Test names follow this format:
'<test id>-<name of file that contains the function being tested>_<class name (if function is a member function)>_<function name>'

* **test-id**        A unique two-digit number. This gives a unique id to each test in the list and orders the list of tests in a file explorer.
* **name of file**   The name of the source file that contains the function's *declaration*.
* **class name**     If the function is a member function, specify the class.
* **function name**  Name of the function.
